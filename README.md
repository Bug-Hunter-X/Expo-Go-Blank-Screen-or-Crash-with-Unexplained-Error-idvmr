# Expo Go Blank Screen or Crash

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Expo Go where the app renders a blank screen or crashes without providing a helpful error message.  The root cause is often related to native module compatibility or inconsistencies between the project's setup and the Expo Go environment.

## Solution

The solution often involves carefully reviewing the project's configuration and ensuring compatibility with Expo Go's environment.  Common steps include checking native module integration, verifying package versions, and comparing the project's manifest with the Expo Go requirements.  Sometimes, even a simple project rebuild or cleaning the cache can resolve the issue.
