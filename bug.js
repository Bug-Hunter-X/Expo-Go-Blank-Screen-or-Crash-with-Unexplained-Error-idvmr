This error occurs when using the Expo Go app to test your React Native application.  The error message itself might not be very informative, but it often manifests as a blank screen or a crash without a clear stack trace in the Expo Go console.  The root cause is typically an issue with native modules or a discrepancy between your project's configuration and the Expo Go environment.
