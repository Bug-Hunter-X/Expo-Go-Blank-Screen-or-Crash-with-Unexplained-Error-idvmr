Debugging this type of error requires a systematic approach:

1. **Check Expo Go Console:** Though the error might not be detailed, check the Expo Go console for *any* clues, warnings, or errors.
2. **Simplify Your App:** If possible, try to isolate the problem by gradually removing parts of your code until you identify which section causes the blank screen.  Create a minimal, reproducible example.
3. **Native Module Compatibility:** Ensure that all your native modules are compatible with Expo Go. Check their documentation and ensure correct installation and configuration.
4. **Check Package Versions:** Review your `package.json` file. Outdated or conflicting dependencies can trigger unexpected behavior in Expo Go.  Try updating packages or locking down versions.  Consider using `yarn` instead of `npm` for better dependency management.
5. **Clean and Rebuild:**  Sometimes, a simple clean and rebuild of your project can resolve issues.  Try deleting the `node_modules` folder and reinstalling packages.
6. **Review Expo Manifest:** Make sure your `app.json` (or `app.config.js`) configuration is consistent with the requirements of Expo Go. Pay attention to permissions, assets, and other settings.
7. **Examine Logs (Advanced):** For deeper diagnostics, examine detailed logs from Expo Go, your device, and even the Expo CLI for any related information.
8. **Use Expo Dev Tools:**  Expo Dev Tools can help you inspect the app's state and network requests, providing insights into potential problems. 

Example (bug.js - showing a simplified problematic component):
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View } from 'react-native';

// Assume 'MyNativeModule' is problematic
import MyNativeModule from 'my-native-module'; // Replace with your module

const MyComponent = () => {
  MyNativeModule.someMethod().then(() => {
      // ...
  }).catch(error => {
      // ...
  });

  return (
      <View>
        {/* App content goes here */}
      </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
Example (bugSolution.js - showing a corrected or simplified component):
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>This is my component!</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
